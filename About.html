                    <h4>The Defender is a desk made to protect students in class from earthquakes and school shooters. There are many desks out their that are made for earthquakes but none that can withstand bullets. Our desk does both at a cheap price of $100. We added crossbars in 3 spots attched to gusset plates to distribute the load on the desk surface and the carbon fiber reinforcing it will be lightweight and bullet proof. It can distribute the force of a bullet or any projectile.</h4>
